# LA-City-Budget

## Indroduction and Problem
The city of Los Angeles has a **$11.8 Billion** fiscal year 22'-23' budget.

As Californians pay some of the highest taxes in the U.S., where exactly are our high tax dollars going? Is this data easily presentable to the public?

We all know payrolls are a hot topic in every industry, but how high are the payrolls of our public servants in Los Angeles? Next, do we have anything to compare them to?

## Goal
The Los Angeles City Controller already has a good UI (when compared to other cities) for high-level budget review. But what if I want to look deeper without sorting through thousands of lines of raw data?

The goal of this project is to create a independent, clear and concise visual review of LA's public payroll for the average viewer that can analyze:
+ By deparment
+ By position
+ Comparison against other major cities (to provide the viewer some bearing)

The dashboard I built was made in Microsoft PowerBI.

**LA Payroll Data Analysis_ver_11.1 (reduced size) is the most current version.**
